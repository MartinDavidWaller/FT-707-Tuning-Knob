# The Yaesu FT-707 Tuning Knob

THE STL AND ASSOCIATED DESIGN PUBLISHED HERE MAY NOT BE USED FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.

When I first discovered Amateur Radio, I craved to have a Yaesu HS SSB Transceiver FT-707. 
Sadly, it was well out of my price range. 

What was the draw? 

Oddly it was the tuning knob.

The tuning was smooth as silk and a dream. It was all down to the design 
of the knob. It was easy to grip. The indentations around the edge are there to ensure a firm hold. 
The dimple is there to ease fine tuning. It was weighted; it had momentum. You could spin it and 
tune from one end of the band to the other in one go.

It was a master class in ergonomic design.

I’ve tried to reproduce the knob using my 3d printer. My chosen design software for this 
is OpenSCAD. The design is expressed in code, and I find this easier than point and click 
design tools. It took a few iterations, but the result is quite pleasing. It’s dimensionally 
as close as I can get to the original and in the rear of the knob there is space to hold lead 
weights. In this case old lead weights from piano keys but fishing weights, or similar, 
would be fine too. The lead is encased in epoxy resin. There is also a recess for a grub 
screw to secure the knob to an encoder shaft.
